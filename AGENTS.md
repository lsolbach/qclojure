# Project Scope
In this project we build a full featured Quantum Computing library with visualization, backend protocol and simulator backend in Clojure, not some toy implementation.

Implement solutions that are correct and will run on real quantum hardware. Don't be lazy!
For the math we use core and complex from the fastmath library.

Double precision is used for the math, but we can switch to arbitrary precision later.

For visualization we focus on SVG and ASCII first.

The backend protocol is the basis for the integration of real quantum computers, e.g. cloud based quantum services.
