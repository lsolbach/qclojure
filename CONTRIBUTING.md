# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to QClojure.

QClojure is a vendor neutral, functional quantum computing library for Clojure. Our goal is to make quantum computing approachable for functional programmers and useful for research, education and (hopefully) the industry.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome: bug reports, feature requests, documentation, tutorials, teaching materials, and code.

## üõ† How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

* Use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/lsolbach/qclojure/issues) for bugs, feature requests, or questions.
* Include:

  * Steps to reproduce (for bugs).
  * Motivation or context (for features).
  * Screenshots/diagrams if relevant.

### 2. Suggesting Features

* Check the [open issues](https://github.com/lsolbach/qclojure/issues?state=open) first.
* Open a new issue with the `enhancement` label if it‚Äôs not listed.
* Clearly describe the problem your feature solves.

### 3. Documentation & Tutorials

* Docs are just as valuable as code!
* Improvements to the README, examples, or tutorials are very welcome.
* If you‚Äôre a teacher or researcher, sharing classroom material built on QClojure is a huge contribution.

### 4. Code

* Fork the repo and create a feature branch:

```
git checkout -b feature/my-new-thing
```

* Keep commits small and meaningful.
* Write tests for new functionality (we use clojure.test).
* Run the test suite before submitting:

```
lein test
```

* Open a Pull Request with:
  * A clear description of the change.
  * Links to related issues.
  * Any open questions for reviewers.

## üîç Getting Help

* [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/lsolbach/qclojure/discussions) for questions/ideas.
* [Clojurians Slack](https://clojurians.net/) ‚Üí `#quantum-computing`.
* Open an issue if you‚Äôre stuck on setup or contribution workflow.
