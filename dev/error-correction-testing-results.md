### Phase 2 Post-Processing Test
Simulated X error on physical qubit 1 of logical qubit 0:

- **Error Rate:** 50% (1 of 2 logical qubits affected)

### Detailed Analysis
```clojure
;; Syndrome extraction results
{:logical-qubit-0 [1 1]   ; X error detected
 :logical-qubit-1 [0 0]}  ; No error

;; Decoded syndromes
{:logical-qubit-0 
 {:syndrome [1 1]
  :error-detected? true
  :error-location "IYI"
  :error-type :x
  :correction-needed? true}
 :logical-qubit-1
 {:syndrome [0 0]
  :error-detected? false
  :error-type :none}}

;; Corrections applied
[{:logical-qubit 0, :physical-qubit 1, :correction :x}]

;; Measurement correction
Original: {0 1, 1 0, 2 1}  ; Qubit 1 flipped incorrectly
Corrected: {0 1, 1 1, 2 1}  ; Qubit 1 restored
```

### Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Shor encoding operational
- Syndrome extraction working
- Error decoding functional
- Classical correction successful

## Test 3: Full Optimization Pipeline Integration

### Setup
- **Input:** 3-qubit circuit (H, CNOT×2, X×2)

### Configuration
| Stage | Enabled | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Gate optimization | ✅ Yes | Redundant gate cancellation |
| Qubit optimization | ❌ No | Incompatible with EC expansion |
| Error correction | ✅ Yes | Bit-flip code |
| Syndrome measurement | ✅ Yes | Phase 1 implementation |
| Topology optimization | ❌ No | Disabled for this test |
| Gate decomposition | ✅ Yes | Final transformation |

### Results
| Metric | Original | Optimized | Expansion |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Qubits | 3 | 15 | 5x |
| Operations | 5 | 42 | 8.4x |

### Error Correction Integration Details
```clojure
;; Logical to Physical mapping
{0 [0 1 2], 1 [3 4 5], 2 [6 7 8]}

;; Logical to Ancillas mapping
{0 [9 10], 1 [11 12], 2 [13 14]}

;; Metadata preserved through pipeline
{:error-correction-applied? true
 :syndrome-measurement-included? true
 :error-correction-code {...}
 :syndrome-table {...}}
```

### Status: ✅ SUCCESS
- Error correction integrates seamlessly with pipeline
- All qubits allocated correctly
- Circuit transformation successful
- Metadata preserved through all stages

## Key Findings

### ✅ Phase 1 Implementation (Syndrome Injection)
1. **inject-syndrome-measurements** function fully operational
2. Proper ancilla allocation per logical qubit
3. Syndrome measurements successfully added to circuits
4. Works with both bit-flip and Shor codes (tested)
5. Circuit expansion handled correctly

### ✅ Phase 2 Implementation (Post-Processing)
1. **extract-syndrome-bits:** Extracts syndrome from measurement results
2. **decode-syndrome-bits:** Identifies error locations from syndromes
3. **apply-classical-correction:** Applies software correction to measurements
4. **analyze-error-correction-results:** Comprehensive analysis entry point
5. All functions working together as designed

### ✅ Pipeline Integration
1. Error correction successfully integrates with hardware optimization
2. Circuit expansion (5x-17x qubits) handled correctly
3. Metadata preserved through all pipeline stages
4. Compatible with gate optimization and decomposition

### ⚠️ Important Constraints
1. **Qubit optimization must be disabled** when using error correction
   - **Alternative:** Run qubit optimization BEFORE applying error correction
   - **Reason:** Qubit removal conflicts with error correction expansion
2. Error correction should run early in pipeline (after qubit opt, before topology)
3. Ancilla qubits must be accounted for in hardware topology requirements

## Circuit Expansion Ratios

### Bit-Flip Code (3-qubit)
- **Qubit expansion:** 5x (3 physical + 2 ancillas per logical)
- **Operation expansion:** ~7-8x depending on circuit
- **Use case:** Simple X error correction

### Shor Code (9-qubit)
- **Qubit expansion:** 17x (9 physical + 8 ancillas per logical)
- **Operation expansion:** ~50-99x depending on circuit
- **Use case:** Both X and Z error correction

### General Pattern
```
Total qubits = (num_logical × physical_per_code) + (num_logical × ancillas_per_code)

Bit-flip:  total = logical × (3 + 2) = logical × 5
Shor:      total = logical × (9 + 8) = logical × 17
```
