;; # About me
;;
;; * Ludger Solbach
;; * Software Architect at 'msg for automotive'
;; * 30+ years experience in different industries
;; * Clojure enthusiast since 2011
;; * [My GitHub page](https://github.com/lsolbach)
;; 
;; # The Motivation
;;
;; * Get experience with AI assisted programming
;; * Learn about quantum computing
;;
;; # The Goal
;;
;; * A production ready library for quantum computing
;;   * Quantum states, gates and circuits
;;   * Library of quantum and hybrid algorithms
;;   * Local simulators and cloud backends
;;   * Visualizations and analysis tools
;; 
;; # The Setup
;; ## IDE
;;
;; * VS Code - Editor
;; * Calva - Clojure IDE for VSCode
;; * Calva Backseat Driver - MCP server with Clojure Tools
;; * Joyride
;;
;; ## AI Models
;;
;; * GitHub Copilot Pro (10$/month)
;;   * Claude Sonnet 4 - goto model for coding and documentation
;;   * GPT - good for research and planning
;;   * Gemini 2.5 Pro - prompt assessment
;;
;; ## MCP Tools
;;
;; * REPL
;;   * testing and exploration
;;   * fast feedback loop for the AI
;; * human intelligence 
;;   * design discussions, planning, reviews
;;   * human in the loop
;;
;; ## Prompts
;;
;; * AGENTS.md - project specific instructions
;; * Instructions - file type specific instructions
;; * Prompts - task specific instructions
;; * Chat Modes - setting the mode of interaction
;;
;; ## The AGENTS.md File
;; * Project purpose and goals
;;
;; ## Instructions
;; * All Clojure related information
;;   * Core principles
;;   * REPL Workflow
;;   * Architecture
;;   * Libraries to use
;;   * Coding style
;;   * Testing approach
;;
;; ## Prompts
;;
;; * Task specific instructions
;; * Research
;; * Assess
;; * With-Calva
;;
;; ## Chat Modes
;; * Devils Advocate
;;
;; ## General Workflow
;;
;; 1. Use Ask mode (or ChatGPT) for research and planning
;; 2. Use Agent mode for implementation, testing and docs
;; 
;; # Demo
;;
;; # Lessons Learned
;;
;; ## What Worked Well
;;
;; * AI providing domain knowledge
;; * using the REPL for testing and exploration
;; * generating initial implementations
;; * generating documentation and comments
;;
;; ## Problems and Challenges
;;
;; * bracket balancing
;;   * I'm much faster at fixing these issues
;; * need to refactor
;;   * code duplications
;;   * for better abstractions and reuse
;; * AI often builds simplified solutions
;;
;; ## Problems and Challenges
;;
;; * context window is limited
;;   * dreaded "summarizing conversation history"
;;   * got better over time
;; * the AI does not learn
;; * quality of responses is inconsistent
;; * following instructions is inconsistent
;;   * e.g. using the command line instead of the REPL
;;
;; ## Tips and Tricks
;;
;; * use different models for different tasks
;; * use different models to assess your prompts
;; * keep prompts short and precise
;; * use the human intelligence to keep you in the loop
;;  
;; # Conclusions
;;
;; * AI is a good pair programmer, bringing in domain knowledge
;; * AI is a bad learner, it does not learn from its mistakes
;; * AI is not a replacement for human intelligence
;;   * need to review, refactor and test everything
;;
;; # Final Thoughts
;;
;; * Without AI assistence, I would not have started this project
;; * I've learned a lot about quantum computing and AI assisted programming
;; * Clojure is the perfect language for AI assisted programming
;;   * iterative REPL driven development with fast feedback for the AI
;;
;; # Thank You!
;; * Questions?
