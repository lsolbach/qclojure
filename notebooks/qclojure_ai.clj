;; # What is QClojure
;;
;; * A Clojure library for quantum computing
;; * Quantum circuits and algorithms
;; * Local simulators and cloud backends
;; * Visualizations and analysis tools
;; 
;; # Motivation
;;
;; * Get experience with AI assisted programming
;; * Learn about quantum computing
;;
;; # Project Setup
;; ## IDE
;;
;; * VS Code - Editor
;; * Calva - Clojure IDE for VSCode
;; * GitHub Copilot Pro - multiple AI models
;; * Calva Backseat Driver - MCP server with Clojure Tools
;; * Joyride
;;
;; ## Models
;;
;; * Claude Sonnet 4 - goto model for coding and documentation
;; * GPT - good for research and planning
;; * Gemini 2.5 Pro - prompt assessment
;;
;; ## Prompts
;; * Chat Modes - setting the mode of interaction
;; * Instructions - file type specific instructions
;; * Prompts - task specific instructions
;; * AGENTS.md - project specific instructions
;;
;; ## MCP Tools
;; * REPL - testing and exploration
;; * human intelligence - design discussions, planning, reviews
;;
;; ## General Workflow
;; 1. use Ask mode (or ChatGPT) mode for research and planning
;; 2. use Agent mode for implementation, testing and documentation
;; 
;; # Lessons Learned
;;
;; ## What Worked Well
;; * bringing in domain knowledge
;; * using the REPL for testing and exploration
;; * generating initial implementations
;; * generating documentation and comments
;;
;; ## Problems and Challenges
;; * bracket balancing
;;   * I'm much faster at fixing these issues
;; * need to refactor
;;   * code duplications
;;   * for better abstractions and reuse
;; * AI often builds simplified solutions
;; * context window is limited
;;   * dreaded "summarizing conversation history"
;;   * got better over time
;; * quality of responses is inconsistent
;; * following instructions is inconsistent
;;   * using the command line instead of the REPL
;;
;; # Summary
;; * Without AI assistence, I would not have started this project
;; * I've learned a lot about quantum computing and AI assisted programming
;; * Clojure is the perfect language for AI assisted programming
;;   * iterative REPL driven development with fast feedback for the AI
;; * AI is a good pair programmer, bringing in domain knowledge
;; * AI is a bad learner, it does not learn from its mistakes
;; * AI is not a replacement for human intelligence
;;   * need to review and test everything
