  "Virtual Distillation for quantum error mitigation through probabilistic error cancellation.
  
  This namespace provides a production-ready implementation of Virtual Distillation,
  an advanced quantum error mitigation technique that improves computation fidelity
  by running multiple copies of quantum circuits and applying sophisticated post-processing
  to extract high-fidelity results through probabilistic error cancellation.
  
  Key capabilities:
  • Multiple circuit copy execution with independent noise realizations
  • Fidelity-weighted result aggregation for optimal error cancellation
  • Probabilistic post-processing with statistical error suppression
  • Production-grade noise model perturbation for realistic copy generation
  • Comprehensive improvement estimation and validation metrics
  • Integration with quantum backends and hardware characterization
  • Scalable implementation for large quantum circuits
  • Robust error handling and graceful degradation
  
  Virtual Distillation Theory:
  
  Virtual Distillation is based on the principle that quantum errors are often
  stochastic and can be partially cancelled through ensemble averaging with
  intelligent weighting. The technique exploits the fact that different copies
  of the same quantum circuit, when run with slightly different noise realizations,
  will have correlated systematic errors but uncorrelated random errors.
  
  Mathematical Foundation:
  If we have M copies of a quantum circuit, each producing a noisy state ρ_noisy^(i),
  the virtual distillation procedure aims to construct an improved state:
  
  ρ_distilled = Σᵢ wᵢ ρ_noisy^(i) / Σᵢ wᵢ
  
  where wᵢ are fidelity-based weights that preferentially emphasize higher-quality results.
  The key insight is that this weighted combination can have higher fidelity than
  any individual copy:
  
  F(ρ_distilled, ρ_ideal) > max{F(ρ_noisy^(i), ρ_ideal)}
  
  Physical Principles:
  
  Virtual Distillation is effective because:
  - **Error Diversity**: Different circuit copies experience independent noise realizations
  - **Statistical Averaging**: Random errors partially cancel through ensemble averaging
  - **Quality Weighting**: Higher-fidelity results are given more influence in the final outcome
  - **Systematic Error Correlation**: Coherent errors remain correlated and can be suppressed
  
  The technique works by:
  1. **Copy Generation**: Create multiple versions of the target circuit with perturbed noise
  2. **Independent Execution**: Run each copy with its own noise realization
  3. **Fidelity Estimation**: Assess the quality of each copy's results
  4. **Weighted Aggregation**: Combine results using fidelity-based weights
  5. **Statistical Enhancement**: Exploit ensemble properties for error suppression
  
  Implementation Strategy:
  
  • **Noise Perturbation**: Small random variations in noise parameters between copies
    to ensure diverse error realizations while maintaining realistic noise characteristics
  • **Fidelity Weighting**: Sophisticated weighting schemes based on estimated fidelity
    to maximize the effectiveness of error cancellation
  • **Statistical Processing**: Robust aggregation algorithms that handle outliers
    and maintain statistical validity of the final results
  • **Resource Optimization**: Efficient allocation of measurement shots across copies
    to maximize information gain within computational budget constraints
  
  Theoretical Advantages:
  • Square-root improvement in error rates for incoherent errors
  • Effective suppression of readout errors and measurement noise
  • Complementary to other error mitigation techniques (ZNE, symmetry verification)
  • No additional quantum resources required (classical post-processing only)
  • Scalable to large quantum systems and complex algorithms
  
  Practical Applications:
  • Variational quantum algorithms (VQE, QAOA) with improved convergence
  • Quantum chemistry calculations requiring high precision
  • Quantum machine learning with enhanced training stability
  • Quantum optimization problems with better solution quality
  • Hardware benchmarking and characterization studies
  • Quantum error correction protocol validation
  
  Production Features:
  • Configurable copy generation strategies for different noise models
  • Adaptive weighting schemes optimized for specific error characteristics
  • Comprehensive statistical analysis and uncertainty quantification
  • Integration with quantum cloud services and hardware backends
  • Performance monitoring and optimization recommendations
  • Detailed diagnostic reporting for troubleshooting and validation"

(defn apply-virtual-distillation
  "Apply comprehensive Virtual Distillation for quantum error mitigation through ensemble averaging.
  
  This function implements a complete Virtual Distillation workflow that significantly
  improves quantum computation fidelity by executing multiple copies of a quantum circuit
  with diverse noise realizations and applying sophisticated post-processing to extract
  higher-quality results through probabilistic error cancellation.
  
  Virtual Distillation Methodology:
  Virtual Distillation leverages the statistical properties of quantum noise to achieve
  error mitigation without additional quantum resources. The core principle is that
  while systematic errors are correlated across circuit copies, random errors are
  independent and can be suppressed through intelligent ensemble averaging.
  
  The algorithm implements several key innovations:
  1. **Diverse Noise Realizations**: Each circuit copy uses slightly perturbed noise
     parameters to ensure independent error realizations while maintaining realistic
     hardware characteristics
  2. **Fidelity-Based Weighting**: Results are weighted by estimated fidelity to
     preferentially amplify higher-quality outcomes
  3. **Statistical Error Cancellation**: Random errors partially cancel through
     weighted ensemble averaging, leading to improved overall fidelity
  4. **Robust Post-Processing**: Advanced aggregation algorithms handle outliers
     and maintain statistical validity
  
  Theoretical Foundation:
  For M circuit copies with fidelities F₁, F₂, ..., F_M, the distilled result
  achieves an effective fidelity that can exceed the best individual copy:
  
  F_distilled ≈ √(Σᵢ wᵢ² Fᵢ²) where wᵢ ∝ Fᵢ
  
  The square-root improvement arises from the statistical suppression of
  incoherent errors through ensemble averaging.
  
  Implementation Features:
  
  • **Realistic Noise Modeling**: Uses production-grade circuit simulation with
    comprehensive error modeling including gate errors, readout errors, and decoherence
  • **Adaptive Copy Generation**: Intelligent perturbation of noise parameters to
    ensure optimal diversity while maintaining physical realism
  • **Sophisticated Weighting**: Fidelity-based weighting scheme that maximizes
    error cancellation effectiveness
  • **Resource Optimization**: Efficient distribution of measurement shots across
    circuit copies to maximize information gain
  • **Statistical Validation**: Comprehensive uncertainty quantification and
    confidence interval estimation
  • **Production Integration**: Designed for real quantum hardware and cloud services
  
  Error Mitigation Effectiveness:
  Virtual Distillation provides significant improvements for many error types:
  - Incoherent errors: √M improvement with M copies (theoretical limit)
  - Readout errors: Linear improvement through statistical averaging
  - Systematic noise: Partial suppression through weight optimization
  - Gate errors: Moderate improvement depending on correlation structure
  
  Typical improvement factors range from 1.5× to 4× for practical quantum systems,
  with best performance on algorithms sensitive to measurement and decoherence errors.
  
  Parameters:
  - circuit: Quantum circuit specification map containing:
           - :operations - Vector of quantum gate operations to execute
           - :num-qubits - Number of qubits in the quantum system
           - :initial-state - Initial quantum state preparation (optional)
           - :metadata - Circuit compilation and optimization information
  - backend: Quantum backend specification map:
           - :noise-model - Base noise characterization for the quantum device
             including gate errors, readout errors, and decoherence parameters
           - :device-info - Hardware topology and connection constraints
           - :execution-config - Backend-specific execution parameters
  - num-copies: Number of circuit copies to execute (typically 2-8 for optimal balance)
              - More copies provide better error suppression but increase computational cost
              - Optimal number depends on noise characteristics and available resources
              - Diminishing returns beyond 6-8 copies for most practical applications
  - num-shots: Total number of measurement shots distributed across all copies
             - Minimum 1000 shots recommended for statistical significance
             - Shots are divided approximately equally among circuit copies
             - Higher shot counts improve statistical precision of distillation
  
  Returns:
  Comprehensive Virtual Distillation results map:
  - :distilled-results - Primary output: error-mitigated measurement count distribution
  - :copy-results - Complete results from each individual circuit copy including:
    - :copy-index - Index of the circuit copy (0 to num-copies-1)

  - :num-copies-used - Actual number of circuit copies executed
  - :average-fidelity - Mean fidelity across all circuit copies
  - :improvement-estimate - Estimated improvement factor from distillation (≥1.0)

                                           :readout-error {:prob-0-to-1 0.05 :prob-1-to-0 0.03}}}

  ;    :improvement-estimate 2.1, :average-fidelity 0.89, :num-copies-used 4, ...}
  
  Usage Guidelines:
  - Use 3-6 copies for optimal balance between improvement and computational cost
  - Ensure sufficient total shots (≥1000) for reliable statistical analysis
  - Validate improvement estimates before using distilled results
  - Consider combining with other error mitigation techniques for maximum benefit
  - Monitor copy fidelity variance to assess distillation effectiveness
  
  Performance Considerations:
  - Computational cost scales linearly with number of copies
  - Memory usage increases with copy storage requirements
  - Optimal copy number depends on error characteristics and resource constraints
  - Parallelization opportunities for independent copy execution
  - Diminishing returns beyond 6-8 copies for most practical systems
  
  Integration with Other Techniques:
  Virtual Distillation is highly complementary to other error mitigation methods:
  - Combine with Zero Noise Extrapolation for comprehensive error suppression
  - Use with symmetry verification for validation and quality assessment
  - Apply before readout error mitigation for enhanced measurement accuracy
  - Integrate with variational optimization for improved algorithm convergence"
