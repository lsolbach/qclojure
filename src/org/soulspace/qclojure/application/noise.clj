(defn apply-readout-noise
  "Apply advanced readout noise with potential correlations.
  
  This function simulates realistic measurement errors that occur in
  actual quantum hardware, including correlated errors between qubits.
  
  Correlated errors model the physical reality that readout errors on one qubit
  can increase or decrease the probability of errors on nearby qubits due to:
  - Electromagnetic crosstalk during readout
  - Charge noise affecting neighboring qubits  
  - Shared readout circuitry interference
  
  The correlation model works as follows:
  1. For each qubit, calculate effective error probability considering correlations
  2. Apply error decisions in a single pass to avoid double-counting
  3. Correlation factors > 1.0 increase error probability, < 1.0 decrease it
  
  Parameters:
  - state: the state to measure
  - num-qubits: number of qubits in the system
  - noise-model: noise model configuration with optional correlated-errors
  
  Correlated-errors format:
  {:correlated-errors {source-qubit {target-qubit correlation-factor, ...}, ...}}
  where correlation-factor > 1.0 increases error probability, < 1.0 decreases it.
  
  Returns: Bitstring representing the measured outcome with readout noise applied"
