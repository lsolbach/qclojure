(ns org.soulspace.qclojure.domain.gate-decomposition
  "Quantum gate decomposition and circuit transformation for quantum hardware compatibility.
  
  This namespace provides functionality to decompose complex quantum gates into simpler,
  hardware-native operations. It enables quantum circuits to be transformed to match the
  specific gate sets supported by different quantum hardware platforms and simulators.
    
  Gate Decomposition:
  - Decomposes complex gates (Toffoli, Fredkin, etc.) into universal gate sets
  - Handles parametric gates (rotation gates with arbitrary angles)
  - Supports multiple decomposition strategies based on target hardware
  
  Circuit Transformation:
  - Transforms entire quantum circuits to use only supported operations
  - Preserves quantum circuit semantics while changing implementation
  - Provides iterative decomposition with cycle detection
  
  Gate Decomposition Examples
  
  ```clojure
  ;; Decompose Toffoli gate for CNOT+T gate set
  (decompose-operation 
    {:operation-type :toffoli 
     :operation-params {:control1 0 :control2 1 :target 2}}
    :cnot-t)
  
  ;; Decompose rotation gate with specific angle
  (decompose-operation
    {:operation-type :ry :operation-params {:target 0 :angle (/ Math/PI 3)}}
    #{:rz :x :cnot})
  ```
