  "Core quantum state representation and operations.
   
   This namespace defines the fundamental data structures and functions
   for representing and manipulating quantum states in QClojure.
   It includes utilities for creating common quantum states, performing
   state normalization, tensor products, and calculating measurement probabilities.
   
   The quantum state is represented as a map with keys:
   - :state-vector: Vector of complex amplitudes (fastmath Vec2)
   - :num-qubits: Number of qubits in the state
   
   The state vector follows the standard computational basis ordering.
   
   QClojure currently uses the fastmath library for complex number support and
   mathematical operations.

   Specs are provided for validation of quantum states and related data structures."

(defn trajectory-to-density-matrix
  "Convert a collection of quantum state trajectories to a normalized density matrix.
   
  This function takes a collection of normalized quantum states (trajectories) and computes
  the corresponding density matrix by averaging the projectors of each state with given weights.
  This is useful for representing mixed states arising from statistical ensembles
  of pure states, such as those from noisy quantum simulations.
   
  Parameters:
  - trajectories: Collection of quantum state maps (each with :state-vector and :num-qubits)
                 All states must be normalized and have the same number of qubits
  - weights: (optional) Collection of weights for each trajectory. Weights will be 
            automatically normalized to sum to 1.0. If not provided, equal weighting is assumed.
   
  Returns:
  Map containing:
  - :density-matrix - The resulting density matrix as a matrix of complex numbers
  - :num-qubits - Number of qubits in the states
  - :trace - Trace of the density matrix (should be 1.0 after normalization)
